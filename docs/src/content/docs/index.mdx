- bare-metal servers and virtual machines
- containerized workloads and Kubernetes clusters
- edge devices and resource-constrained environments
- long-running production monitoring agents

The project emphasizes:
- native performance with Rust
- modular and extensible metric collectors
- simple, explicit configuration
- secure and reliable transport
